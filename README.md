# Real-Laser-Pointer
A wearable laser pointer with an HC-SR04 module and a 0.91" OLED that displays the distance to whatever you point at. Powered by an Arduino Nano and built for Hack Club's Alleyway program.

Simply wear the attachment on your finger, turn it on, and it will periodically send ultrasonic beams from the HC-SR04 sensor attached, calculate the distance from the echo time, and display it on the 0.91" OLED screen mounted on top! And in typical hacker fashion, everything is thrown together with electrical tape! Power is supplied by a power bank in your pocket, supplying the brains: an Arduino Nano, which is also in your pocket. I also have to make this without soldering because it might cause the smoke detector in my dorm to go off :heavysob:
